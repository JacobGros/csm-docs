Description: "About Docker Enterprise Edition"

The Dell CSI Drivers support Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) & deployment on clusters bootstrapped with UCP (Universal Control Plane).

The installation process for the driver on such clusters remains the same as the installation process on upstream clusters.

On UCP based clusters, kubectl may not be installed by default, it is important that kubectl is installed prior to the installation of the driver.

The worker nodes on UCP backed clusters may run any of the OSs which we support with upstream clusters.
